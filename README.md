## Short Text Classification Accompanying WordNet

The purpose of this project is to load a short string of words and then expand the understanding of each word (in terms of hyponyms). Once expanded, each set will be compared amongst each other (similar to Insertion Sort), if the latter set has a word which is similar to the initial set, the latter's root word will be renamed to the initial's root word.

**Example Input:** luminous function light fast cold quick <br>
**Example Output:** luminous function luminous fast cold fast
